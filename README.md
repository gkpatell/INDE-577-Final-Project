# INDE-577-Final-Project
This repository showcases my final project for CMOR 438/INDE 577: Data Science &amp; Machine Learning, under the guidance of Dr. Randy R. Davila. The project demonstrates my understanding of key supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and their implementation on unique datasets, adhering to real-world applications.

- Repository Structure
  The repository is organized into two main directories:
    - Supervised Learning: Contains implementations of:
      - [The Perceptron](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/The Perceptron/SL_Perceptron.ipynb)
      - [Linear Regression](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Linear Regression/SL_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
      - [Logistic Regression](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Logistic Regression/SL_Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
      - [Neural Networks](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Neural Networks/SL_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
      - [K Nearest Neighbors](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/K Nearest Neighbor/SL_K_Nearest_Neighbor.ipynb)
      - [Decision Trees/Regression Trees](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Decision (Regression) Trees/SL_Decision_Trees.ipynb]
      - [Random Forests](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Random Forest/SL_Random_Forest.ipynb)
      - [Other Ensemble Methods](gkpatell/Supervised Learning/Other Ensemble Methods/SL_OEMS.ipynb), including Boosting

    - Unsupervised Learning: Includes implementations of:
      - K-Means Clustering
      - DBSCAN
      - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      - Image Compression with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

- Project Objectives
  The primary goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms on datasets that differ from those used during lectures, demonstrating:
    - Theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
    - Insightful analysis and clear visualization of results.
    - Comprehensive documentation for reproducibility.

- Key Highlights
    - Unique Datasets: Real-world datasets were selected to enhance the relevance of the algorithms.
    - Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations, including decision boundaries, confusion matrices, and clustering plots.
    - Reproducibility: All code and datasets are accompanied by clear instructions for replication.

- How to Use This Repository
  Navigate to the Supervised Learning or Unsupervised Learning directories based on your interest.

- Each directory contains:
    - Python scripts implementing the algorithms.
    - A README.md file explaining the dataset, algorithm, and reproduction steps.
    - Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README files to run the code.
