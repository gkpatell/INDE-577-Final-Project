# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on Wine Quality Dataset

## Project Overview
- This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Wine Quality Dataset. The goal is to classify wines as "Good" or "Bad" based on their physicochemical properties.

## Key Features
  - Utilizes the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI ML Repository.
  - Binarizes wine quality into "Good" (>=6) and "Bad" (<6).
  - Includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
  - Provides detailed performance analysis and visualizations.

## Project Structure
  - Dataset: Wine Quality Dataset (Red Wine)
  - Code: Implementation in Python using Scikit-learn
  - Analysis: Includes confusion matrices, accuracy trends, and error analysis.

## How to Run
  - Install required libraries: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  - Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
  - Analyze the results and visualizations.

## Results
  - Baseline Accuracy: ~0.70
  - Tuned Model Accuracy: ~0.74
