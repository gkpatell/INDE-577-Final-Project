# Introduction to Supervised Learning

- Supervised learning is a fundamental branch of machine learning where a model learns to make predictions or decisions based on labeled data. In this type of learning, the training dataset consists of input-output pairs where the input data (“features”) is associated with corresponding output labels (“targets”). The primary goal of supervised learning is to train a model that can generalize well to unseen data and make accurate predictions.

## Key Characteristics of Supervised Learning

1. **Labeled Data**:
   - Each input sample is paired with a corresponding output label.
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.

2. **Goal**:
   - Minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.
   - Learn a mapping function: `f(input) -> output`.

3. **Applications**:
   - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., stock prices, temperature).
   - **Classification**: Categorizing data into discrete classes (e.g., spam detection, disease diagnosis).

## Algorithms Explored

This repository includes implementations of various supervised learning algorithms, each demonstrated on unique datasets to showcase their strengths and limitations. Below is an overview of the algorithms we have worked on so far:

### 1. **The Perceptron**
   - A linear classifier that separates data using a hyperplane.
   - Suitable for linearly separable datasets.
   - Example: Binary classification tasks.

### 2. **Linear Regression**
   - A regression algorithm used to predict continuous target values by fitting a straight line to the data.
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on square footage.

### 3. **Logistic Regression**
   - A classification algorithm used to predict probabilities of discrete classes.
   - Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

### 4. **Neural Networks**
   - Multi-layered models inspired by biological neural networks, capable of learning complex patterns.
   - Example: Image recognition, text classification.

### 5. **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to labeled neighbors.
   - Example: Recommender systems.

### 6. **Decision Trees**
   - A tree-like model used for both classification and regression by splitting data based on feature values.
   - Example: Credit risk analysis.

### 7. **Random Forests**
   - An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - Example: Fraud detection in financial transactions.

### 8. **Ensemble Methods (Boosting)**
   - Combines weak learners to create a strong learner by iteratively correcting errors.
   - Example: Customer churn prediction using Gradient Boosting or AdaBoost.

## Limitations of Supervised Learning
- **Labeled Data Requirement**: Relies on labeled datasets, which can be expensive or time-consuming to obtain.
- **Overfitting**: Models may memorize training data instead of generalizing to unseen data if not properly regularized.
- **Scalability**: Performance may degrade with large datasets or complex problems.
