# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

This repository showcases various unsupervised learning algorithms implemented using Python and machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that is not labeled, where the model learns patterns, structures, and relationships within the data on its own. The algorithms included in this repository help to explore and extract meaningful insights from data without the need for labeled outputs.

## Key Algorithms Implemented:

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms, where the goal is to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and then updates the centroids based on the mean of the points in each cluster.

- **Key Steps**:
  1. Initialize K centroids randomly.
  2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  3. Update centroids based on the mean of the assigned points.
  4. Repeat the process until convergence.
  
- **Applications**: Market segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression.

### 2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and can also identify noise (outliers) in the data. Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be predefined.

- **Key Parameters**:
  - **Epsilon (Îµ)**: The maximum distance between two samples to be considered neighbors.
  - **MinPts**: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region (cluster).
  
- **Applications**: Spatial data analysis, anomaly detection, noise filtering.

### 3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features while retaining as much variance as possible. It transforms the data into a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components), ranked by the variance they explain.

- **Applications**: Data visualization, feature selection, noise reduction.

### 6. **Autoencoders (Deep Learning)**
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. They aim to learn a compressed, lower-dimensional representation (encoding) of the input data through an encoder-decoder architecture.

- **Applications**: Anomaly detection, image compression, denoising.
